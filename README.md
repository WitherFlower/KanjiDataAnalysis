I made this to see which were the most frequent kanji that were not in my Anki deck (RTK)

The fist 300 of them are the following :

云其此來或廻於氣貰也坐樣國龍筈逢學訊斯處這燈實當殆叩顏體喰庄篇爺眞蘭澤謂汝迄駈覗噂蔭而會厭嘘嬉歸蒼聲
庵蓮妾衞呑兎洲李對馴浩爲變斐嘉卿喧雀惡揃狼藝幡溜掻恰兩淋尤馳發亦槍筑鼠綺噛嘩掴蘇薩濡曾忽關柴宏狐呆萩
駕胡稀綾輔儘傳鷹繋丞磯杖呟惚撫數萬祐梁睨經菅慾禄駿餘篠劉塵哉巴覺廣蒙淵樂洩註亮拵乍遥殘喋讀與牢壺讃爾
牡憐宋鴨翔應燭觀瑞條頸隈夷嶋曳尖纏紐圓藏妓戰屍悶賑藪陀叢摺乘讐淳霞桶從靜穿悉菩溢蝋芥寢敦倶仔焚盃樽續
錢俄參惹楊怯隱棲汲獅袴狗點嘗鞭囁捧裡臺鷲磐吊燕歎啼仇畠紗套梯臥秦邊魏惣昂蹟些辿纂遙聯儲梶播袂迦獨聽竣
奧莫祀窺焔慧襖蛙薇藁斷頷揉渠薔賣證碗顫嶺豹埃晋茫橘聡晃釘甥洛鞍俯諏譯昏卷佛吻耶冴拔樺淀髯彌皺綴遁默噌

Adding these to my deck would mean that it would contain a total of 2500 kanji, and would 
include all of the 2276 most common kanji in the Japanese language (according to the dataset).
